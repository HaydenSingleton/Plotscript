Introduction
-------------
**This project was built on code written by my professor, Christopher L. Wyatt (https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/wyatt).**

This semester long project implements a basic interpreter for an interpreted language called PlotScript. It includes unit and integration tests for the base implementation, a driver program implementing a command line REPL, and a program which uses Qt to draw a basic GUI for more complex output. These are called (plotscript) and (notebook) respectively.
